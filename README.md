# Fostrom DeviceKit

[Fostrom](https://fostrom.io) is an IoT Cloud Platform built for developers. Monitor and control your fleet of devices, from microcontrollers to industrial IoT. Designed to be simple, secure, and fast. Experience first-class tooling with Device SDKs, type-safe schemas, programmable actions, and more.

This repository contains the following:

* **Fostrom Device Agent** - A small lightweight binary that runs in the background on your IoT devices. The Device Agent is automatically downloaded and started by our Device SDKs.
* **Fostrom Device SDKs** - The Fostrom Device SDKs make it super-easy to get started and integrate with Fostrom on your devices.

We have Device SDKs for three languages currently:

* Elixir
* Python
* JavaScript (Node.js/Bun)

Refer to the [SDK Docs](https://fostrom.io/docs/sdk/) for more information about how to use our SDKs and how they work.
